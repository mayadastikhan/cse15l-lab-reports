I have been having an ongoing issue in my ListExamples.java and I am not sure what is wrong. I'm trying to implement a method merge in my ListExamples class which should take two sorted lists of strings and return a new list containing all the strings from both lists in sorted order. However, when I run my tests, I'm getting a failure with an IndexOutOfBoundsException. Here's a screenshot of the error message:

```
I think the bug might be related to how I'm iterating over the elements of the lists, but I'm not entirely sure. Any help or suggestions would be greatly appreciated! Below is the code.
